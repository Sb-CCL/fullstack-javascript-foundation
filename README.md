# Fullstack JavaScript Foundation

This project documents my journey in working with the fundamentals of Fullstack JavaScript development. It is organized by weeks, with each week containing dedicated folders that include practical examples, exercises, and resources for learning. Throughout this project, I will explore key concepts in JavaScript, front-end and back-end development, and the tools that power modern web applications.

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

### [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current)

Allows you to run JavaScript code as well as and manage dependencies with `npm` or `yarn`.

- **Min Version:** `14.x` (Recommended: `16.x` or later for the latest features and performance improvements)

### [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

It is a distributed version control system, essential for cloning the repository and managing version control.

- **Min Version:** `2.x`

A versatile IDE for coding, debugging, and running JavaScript applications.

- **Suggested Extensions:**
