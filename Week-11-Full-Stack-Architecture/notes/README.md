## 4. What I Learned This Week 🧠

I learned how to use express and cors as a middleware to setup routes so that data can be put and pulled from the api.

## 5. Challenges Faced 🚧

It was difficult trying to get the api to work since there were no frontend errors, I had to use postman to test if it was working and tried to figure my way to getting it functional.

## 6. Wins of the Week 🏆

Getting the api to act as expected and succesfully having the data post to the front end as expected.

## 7. Next Week’s Focus 🔭

Next week, we are working on Relational Databases and SQL.
