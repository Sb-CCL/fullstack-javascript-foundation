// Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?

// Uppercase const?
const BIRTHDAY = "18.04.1982"; // make birthday uppercase?
const AGE = someCode(BIRTHDAY); // make age uppercase?

// Answer: Uppercase should only be used if we know the value will not change, so for birthday is appropriate but not for age as age changes every year.
